Changes in version 1.04 (March 23, 2020)
- Changed HOLD and DISP button to default display mode from label display mode.
This might solve the display problem in Max 8.
- Reduced CPU usage when parameters are automated by defer automation output option.
- Refined the animation logic so that draws accurately when changing parameters and slightly reduced overall CPU usage.
